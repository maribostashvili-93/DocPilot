#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/sync-platform.sh — push platform changes from DocPilot-Aviator to the
# public DocPilot mirror.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. You make a platform fix in this repo (DocPilot-Aviator), commit, push.
#   2. Run `npm run sync-platform`.
#   3. The script clones DocPilot public into /tmp, rsync's every file EXCEPT
#      tenant content paths from your working copy, shows the diff, and asks
#      before committing + pushing.
#
# Tenant content paths (ALWAYS skipped — these differ between the two repos):
#   - content/                       (per-tenant docs/games/sections JSON)
#   - src/data/manualContent.ts      (Aviator manual HTML body)
#   - server/seed-state.json         (first-boot CMS state)
#   - public/images/minescape/       (Minescape screenshots)
#   - public/images/backoffice/      (back-office screenshots)
#   - public/images/manual/          (manual screenshots)
#   - .docpilot-data/                (runtime data; gitignored anyway)
#   - node_modules/                  (dependencies; gitignored)
#   - dist/                          (build output; gitignored)
#   - .git/                          (handled separately)
